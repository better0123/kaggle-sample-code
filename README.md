# Kaggle Competitions - Sample Code

![](images/kaggle.png)

This repo contains some of the code I've written for Kaggle's Machine Learning competitions in 2010-2016. 

Over time, I gained a Kaggle Competitions Grandmaster rating, and achieved a peak ranking of #4.

## Competition Details

I need to fill in more details here, highlighting:
- Some particuarly interesting competitions (e.g. the Essay competition)
- Some particularly clear or clever pieces of code

Much of this code was written very quickly within the limited timeframe for each contest.
There are certainly messy and inefficient pieces (though to be fair this code was never 
meant for production, just prototyping), and also some clever pieces, too.

In aggregate, I've written approximately:
- 45K lines of Python
- 26K lines of R
- 4K  lines of Java
- 3K  lines of bash

In addition, I have some Kaggle 'kernels' code, which can be seen at: https://www.kaggle.com/chefele/kernels
