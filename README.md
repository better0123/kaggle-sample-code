# Kaggle Sample Code

![](images/kaggle.png)

This repo contains a sample of code I've written for Kaggle competitions in the years 2010-2016. 

Over time, I achieved a Kaggle GrandMaster ranking (top 0.1%). See: https://www.kaggle.com/chefele

## Competition Details

I will fill in more details here, describing some particuarly interesting competitions to focus on (e.g. Essay competition).

Much of this code was written very quickly for exploring different approaches, and it is admittedly messy in (many) spots.

In aggregate, for these competitions, I've written:
- 45K lines of Python
- 26K lines of R
- 4K  lines of Java
- 3K  lines of bash
