# Kaggle Competitions - Sample Code

![](images/kaggle.png)

This repo contains some of the code I've written for Kaggle competitions in 2010-2016. 

Over time, I achieved a Kaggle Competitions Grandmaster ranking (top 0.1%), and at my peak was ranked #4. See: https://www.kaggle.com/chefele

## Competition Details

I need to fill in more details here, describing:
- Some particuarly interesting competitions (e.g. the Essay competition)
- Some particularly nice pieces of code

Much of this code was written very quickly for exploring different approaches, and it is admittedly messy in (many) spots; it was never meant for production. 

In aggregate, for these competitions, I've written:
- 45K lines of Python
- 26K lines of R
- 4K  lines of Java
- 3K  lines of bash

In addition, I have some Kaggle 'kernels' code, which can be seen at: https://www.kaggle.com/chefele/kernels
